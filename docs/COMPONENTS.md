# Component guidance

This file records reusable patterns as they are approved. Update it whenever a reusable component or meaningful variant is introduced.

## Container

`.container` provides the standard maximum width and responsive gutter. `.container--narrow` controls readable text-led sections. Do not add arbitrary page-level widths when either pattern works.

## Typography

Global heading and body rules live in `css/base.css`; type tokens live in `css/tokens.css`. `.eyebrow` is a compact contextual label and should be used sparingly. `.lede`, `.text-large`, and `.text-small` cover common text hierarchy without local one-off sizes.

## Buttons

- `.button.button--primary`: the principal action in a section.
- `.button.button--secondary`: a lower-priority action on a light surface.
- `.button.button--on-dark`: a clear action on a dark surface.

Buttons use modest radii, strong labels, visible focus, and a minimum touch-friendly height. Avoid inventing colour variants without a semantic reason.

## Links

Default links retain browser-understandable semantics. `.text-link` provides a prominent inline or standalone directional link. Links and buttons must not be distinguished by colour alone when context is ambiguous.

## Sections

`.section` supplies standard responsive vertical rhythm. `.section--compact`, `.section--bordered`, and `.section--dark` are initial variants. A section variant should represent a reusable structural treatment, not a single page's decoration.

## Header and navigation

The global header is a compact sticky white surface with a fine lower border. It contains the replaceable text wordmark, primary navigation, account/sales utilities, and one primary conversion action.

Desktop navigation uses explicit buttons for dropdowns rather than hover-only interaction. Only one dropdown may be open at once. Products uses the larger two-part menu: the active Qavyo Restaurant family and capability groups occupy the main area; a quiet secondary area communicates that Retail and Marketing are future categories without presenting them as available products. Solutions, Resources, and Company use restrained single-column menus.

At widths up to `60rem`, desktop navigation is replaced by a dedicated full-height mobile menu. Products, Solutions, Resources, and Company use expandable panels; the desktop mega-menu is never squeezed into the mobile viewport. Opening the mobile menu locks background scrolling. Touch targets are at least approximately 44px.

Required behaviour lives in `js/main.js`: click and keyboard activation, `ArrowDown` entry into desktop menus, one-open-menu enforcement, outside-click dismissal, Escape dismissal with focus restoration, mobile accordion state, and viewport-change cleanup. Triggers must retain accurate `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` relationships.

Unavailable routes use `data-prototype-link` and are prevented from navigating until real destinations exist. Replace these placeholders with real URLs as pages are approved; do not create fake pages solely for navigation.

## Footer

The current footer is intentionally minimal and internal. A public footer architecture will be created separately when approved.

## Cards

`.card` is a restrained bordered surface for content that needs containment. Do not default every feature or idea to a card. Prefer layout, typography, and dividers when grouping is already clear.

## Product UI frames

`.product-frame` demonstrates the initial framing language for illustrative operational UI. Frames need a clear explanatory purpose, legible content, and an illustrative label when not showing the real product. Avoid fake metrics and decorative dashboard clutter.

## Responsive and accessibility requirements

Every component must keep a logical reading and tab order, visible keyboard focus, sufficient colour contrast, meaningful semantics, and reasonable touch targets. Responsive behaviour must be designed, not assumed. Motion must respect reduced-motion preferences.
